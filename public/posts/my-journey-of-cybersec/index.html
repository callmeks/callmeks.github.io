That is also when I found out that there are a lot of different hacking.\nPart 1 I just keep playing with these 2 platform for quite some times until I found out some other interesting stuff, which is certification. One of the most popular cert is OSCP, which is commonly discussed by people. Although I don’t have the money to get the certification, I noticed that a lot of people just talked about TJ Null list when discussing about OSCP. After searching about TJ Null list, it is a list of recommended boxes for people to play around for preparing OSCP. Since some of the boxes are free from vulnhub, I just play around some of it and learn some interesting knowledge. Aside of that, I started to participate some CTF competition online as a solo player and also play around with PwnTillDawn. As for hackthebox, I never touched any of the machines as I tried once and I dont know how to proceed with it. So I just run away and go to other platform. That’s how I started for the first 2 years.\nPart 2 Here’s the part two where I started to approach people and play together. This whole thing started just because I attended a camp called Malaysia Cybersecurity Camp (MCC). I would say MCC change the way I understand cybersecurity and working alone is never gonna bring me to anywhere. Aside from that, learning together seems to be more fun and it is also easier to learn since there are a lot of pro in MCC. After this camp, I started to play around with people that have the same interest and a lot of fun stuff happened.\nSuggestion for people that wanted to get invole into cybersecurity remember to take notes get some friends that have the same interest and learn together just keep learning ",

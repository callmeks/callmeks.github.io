That is a part of the challenge, try to overcome it.\nAuthor: Trailbl4z3r \u0026 Monaruku\nhint: Tbh this is not a natively built app, more like something just wrapped into an app\nWorld-II.apk\nSolution Since it’s an APK file, Lets start with jadx-gui for static analysis. In terms of static analysis, it’s always best to check out AndroidManifest.xml first.\nBased on the code, there’s only one activity which is systems.altimit.rpgmakermv.WebPlayerActivity. Double click and see the activity code. There’s a lot of function in the WebPlayerActivity but I’ll be focusing on onCreate function first as that it is the starting point for all activities.\nAccording to the code, it is trying to construct the game by getting the value of id.application.rpgmakermv.R.string.mv_project_index. I then tried to have a look and search for the strings values. By using the global search feature in jadx-gui, I managed to get the strings value.\nNow that I know the value is //android_asset/www/index.html, my first thought is checking out for the files using the global search feature.\nWhile the index.html does not have a lot of code, I noticed that it’s using main.js. I then look for it and have a look in it.\nLooking into main.js, there’s a lot of code and several script as well. I then look into each of it and see which is interesting.\nLooking into rmmz_managers.js, I noticed that database file that are stored as json file. I then look into Actors.json as it seems like the game character’s database file.\nSince this is a json file, I think that I could modify the json file and repack the apk to make the me win easily. Since I have limited information at the moment, I tried to run the apk and see how the game works.\nHere’s how the main page looks like, which is similar to the index.html. I then started to play around to get more information.\nHere’s my current stat and equipment. I then look into the Actors.json to compare and identify which value I should modify. I noticed that the equip is the current weapon and body that the character has. The weapon database file is Weapons.json.\nThe id of the weapon is same as the number provided in equip in Actors.json. My next thought was to increase the damage of the weapon Dragon Blade since I could just edit the json file and repack it. While I have no idea, the params definitely consist the damage of the weapon. I then randomly edit every params into high value. To do so, I’ll need to unpack first.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 PS D:\\Desktop\\Android\\world2\u003e apktool d .\\World_II.apk I: Using Apktool 2.10.0 on World_II.apk with 8 thread(s).

I: Regular manifest package... I: Copying assets and libs... I: Copying unknown files... I: Copying original files... Press any key to continue . . . After unpack the APK file, search for Weapons.json and modfiy the params value of Dragon Blade to 999. After modifying it, repack it.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 PS D:\\Desktop\\Android\\world2\u003e apktool b .\\World_II\\ -o world-2-modified.apk I: Using Apktool 2.10.0 with 8 thread(s).

I: Copying unknown files/dir... I: Built apk into: world-2-modified.apk Press any key to continue . . . After repacking the APK, remember to sign it. To do so, create a keystore.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 PS D:\\Desktop\\Android\\world2\u003e keytool -genkey -v -keystore modify.keystore -alias modify_key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 Enter keystore password: Re-enter new password: Enter the distinguished name. Provide a single dot (.) to leave a sub-component empty or press ENTER to use the default value in braces. What is your first and last name? What is the name of your organizational unit? What is the name of your organization? What is the name of your City or Locality? What is the name of your State or Province? What is the two-letter country code for this unit? Is CN=a, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown correct? [no]: yes Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate (SHA384withRSA) with a validity of 10,000 days for: CN=a, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown [Storing modify.keystore] After the keystore is created, sign the APK file.\n1 2 PS D:\\Desktop\\Android\\world2\u003e apksigner sign --ks .\\modify.keystore .\\world-2-modified.apk Keystore password for signer #1: After that, Just run the game and hope everything is working.\nAs shown in image, I managed to change the weapon stats by modifying the params value. Now that my stats are high, I could easily win the game.\nAfter I win each boss, I’ll get a partial flag.\nFlag 1 Flag 2 Flag 3 Flag 4 This part of flag appear in the map after winning boss 4 Flag 5 After winning the boss, you will need to talk to a dude and it will give you 23 7 13 25 which is order of the alphabelt wgmy.

<p>Since it&rsquo;s an APK file, Lets start with <code>jadx-gui</code> for static analysis. In terms of static analysis, it&rsquo;s always best to check out <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> first.</p>
